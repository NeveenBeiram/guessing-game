* we learned new css such as nth-child for changing the odd or even list items for example. 

* we learned about eslint : which is rules we must do and there will be an error if we not doing it right .

* we learned about the switch which is simellar to while  in some concept .

* learned about
 
 ```
`use strict`;
``` 
which tell that we are not allowed to use any undefined variable.
